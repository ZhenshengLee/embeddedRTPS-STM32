# Embedded RTPS on STM32
This repository contains all components necessary to create a minimal working example, showing the communication of an STM32 using Embedded RTPS. 
1. The first component in the `stm32` folder is a STM32CubeIDE project which uses EmbeddedRTPS to send a simple RTPS message.
2. The second component in the `linux` folder is a C++ project using the ASOA RTPS Driver library and Eprosima FastRTPS to receive the message sent by STM32.
